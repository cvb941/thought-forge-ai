## Background

I've recently seen a fair amount of "philosophical" and story-telling content on social media. Common traits are a calm voice, soothing music, calm pictures and a discussion of some topic of self-improvement, or love, or the world and our place in it. I enjoy this content which the algorithms have noticed.

Some of this type of content has clearly AI-generated elements, for example using the same voice or images that are slightly off. So I wondered how hard it would be to create similar content in a 100% automated manner. Turns out, it's pretty easy. It's also pretty hilarious to create thoughtful content about human struggles in modern life fully with AI.

## Quality

Sometimes the quality is surprisingly good, both in the topic and structure as well as the video. Mostly it is somewhat mediocre. I think the output could be improved a bit with better prompts, and significantly with more cherry-picking or using (human) source material.
