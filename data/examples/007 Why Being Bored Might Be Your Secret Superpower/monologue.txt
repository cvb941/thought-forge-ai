Boredom. We run from it like the plague, filling every moment with noise, screens, and distractions. But what if I told you that boredom is your untapped superpower? In those empty spaces, your mind wanders, connections form, and creativity blooms. It's in boredom that we truly meet ourselves, confront our deepest thoughts, and solve problems we didn't even know we had. So next time you feel that itch to reach for your phone, resist. Sit with the discomfort. Let your mind roam free. Because in the void of boredom lies the seed of your next great idea. Embrace the emptiness, and watch as it fills you with possibility.
